        <div class="paragraph content">
          <h2 id="week1">Week 1 : Getting Started</h2 id="#week1">
          <p>This week was a rough one, admittedly. I had taken this class before and the anticipation was getting to
            me.
            I was anxious because my previous attempt at the class left me with an A- after a teammate ditched our team
            in
            the final part of the semester. I worried that retaking the class, with the knowledge I had gained in the
            two
            years since taking the class, might still yield a similar result if my team was not as devoted to making a
            good grade as I was.</p>

          <p>I reached out to the instructor, who set my mind at ease. The final project had been changed to an
            individual
            one. I breathed a sigh of relief, for now my destiny would be truly tied in to what I produced and the work
            I
            put in and not solely on the integrity of my team. I left the week feeling optimistic.</p>

      <!-- WEEK 2 -->
      <section class="innerPadding fullwidth journal whiteOverlay">
        <div class="paragraph">
          <h2 id="week2">Week 2 : Forming Teams</h2 id="#week1">
          <p>This week was not as stressful as the previous week given it was mostly about organizing into teams and
            establishing a system. I am cautiously optimistic that my team will help to shoulder the load of teaching
            this
            semester, but I am worried about Thembinkosi and his time difference. It'll be 3:30am his time on our
            recurring meeting times, which is bound to be incredibly difficult for him. I admire his optimism, but I
            feel
            it would break me personally.</p>
          <p>This is not to say I don't want to work with him, he seems a nice guy, just that I feel he might struggle
            with the time difference. I'm going to hope for the best and we'll see what he can do! We set up a teaching
            schedule and I think we'll be able to get everything done by week 10 so we can devote time to the final
            projects. That is my hope!</p>

      <!-- WEEK 3 -->
      <section class="innerPadding fullwidth journal grayOverlay">
        <div class="paragraph">
          <h2 id="week3">Week 3 : The meeting that wasn't.</h2>
          <p>This week was a tough one to get right. Kenny had our lesson on Wednesday, our scheduled meeting night, but
            due to some mixups was not able to stay long on the day of the meeting when some of our team was running
            late.
            He left with the anouncement that we would try the next night, so we tried to do it again the next day. It
            turned out that this was also a no-go as Kenny had another group meeting that night, which he evidently
            couldn't miss either. He determined that he would record himself teaching the topics he had been assigned to
            teach and that we would try again later in the week.</p>
          <p>This pattern of log-in tag was repeated every night with everyone having struggles to meet up. The
            reasons were for the most part legitimate, with Kimi having to cancel one night after taking her child to
            the
            emergency room. In the end, we chalked it up to bad luck and sought to try again next week.</p>

      <!-- WEEK 4 -->
      <section class="innerPadding fullwidth journal whiteOverlay">
        <div class="paragraph">
          <h2 id="week4">Week 4 : Learning the ways of JSON</h2>
          <p>I must admit, although I took this class two years ago and learned JSON then, I haven't used it since and
            so was rather rusty with my memories of it. I had a lot of fun working on making JSON code and incorporating
            it into my JavaScript demonstrations. It was my turn to teach this week and I decided the best way to teach
            JSON was with some real working examples. I took my group to my JSON page and worked through the examples
            that I had created and explained the ins and outs of how JSON is used. I thought it went well.</p>
          <p>JSON is a highly useful language and interestingly I am taking a C# based class this semester where it is
            now something we are using to store data. Interesting that in the two years since I took this class I hadn't
            used it once, but then almost as soon as I am to teach it in this class I need it for that one. Funny how
            that works isn't it? I think I will end up using the things I taught more than those whom I taught them to.

      <!-- WEEK 5 -->
      <section class="innerPadding fullwidth journal grayOverlay">
        <div class="paragraph">
          <h2 id="week5">Week 5 : Playing with Storage</h2>
          <p>I think Thembinkosi did a great job teaching this week. The idea of local and session storage is a
            complicated one and I think that I came to understand the topic better than I had before. I took this class
            a long time ago, and I thought that I would have remembered a lot of things, but it seems I forgot a lot of
            stuff. </p>
          <p>I went into Codepen and played around quite a bit and I think that I came to have a lot of good fun with
            the idea. The id component of session and local storage was not something I remembered, or perhaps did not
            truly explore. Was a good refresher!</p>
        </div>

      <!-- WEEK 6 -->
      <section class="innerPadding fullwidth journal whiteOverlay">
        <div class="paragraph">
          <h2 id="week6">Week 6 : Dom Manipulation</h2>
          <p>I had this week's lesson and I put a lot of effort into preparing my competency site so that I could base
            my comments off of what I had on here. Unfortunately, in my efforts to make my site more fancy, I came to
            realize that I had forgotten some of the content for my lesson. When I started to teach, Thembinkosi asked
            me a question regarding cloning of dom elements and I completely spaced. It turned out that the original
            answer that I had given him was off and that I had to go back and re-read the material.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, I was able to provide a great resource for it and ended up messaging him later with the
            answers he sought. I learned a bit from the exchange as I now understand a lot better how it works.</p>
        </div>

      <!-- WEEK 7 -->
      <section class="innerPadding fullwidth journal grayOverlay">
        <div class="paragraph">
          <h2 id="week7">Week 7 : Filling in</h2>
          <p>I wasn't supposed to teach this week, but Kimi was struggling with morning sickness and Kenny didn't
            realize he was supposed to be teaching. Since I already had the content created for this webpage, I just
            decided to take it on myself. I was able to draw from what I already had created and it made for some great
            content. I'll admit, I was a little unpolished on video as I hadn't intended to teach, but I think it went
            pretty well. I did make an error on video, but I submitted the correction to the group chat and a link to
            the content for my team to peruse after the fact.</p>
        </div>

      <!-- WEEK 8 -->
      <section class="innerPadding fullwidth journal whiteOverlay">
        <div class="paragraph">
          <h2 id="week8">Week 8 : Ghosted</h2>
          <p>
            This week Thembinkosi was scheduled to teach, but he had something come up at the last minute and so
            completely
            ghosted. I tried to reach out and have him commit to another night, but I got no response from him. I've yet
            to hear from him about it. This to me demonstrates the challenges with group assignments. You either rise
            together or fall together, and in this case we fell. We didn't meet, not by my choice, but because nobody
            else in my group even showed up or responded to my efforts to spark something. It's getting late in the
            semester and I'm considering that if nobody meets next week with me then I'll just hold meetings by myself.
          </p>

      <!-- WEEK 9 -->
      <section class="innerPadding fullwidth journal grayOverlay">
        <div class="paragraph">
          <h2 id="week9">Week 9 : Business end of the Semester</h2>
          <p>So, my faith in my team has recovered substantially after last week's 'ghosting' and muted responses. While
            we still haven't heard from Thembinkosi, we were able to meet and ended up just teaching eachother what he
            was scheduled to teach last week. It wasn't ideal, but I think we were able to share some good content. I
            spent some good time talking about canvas elements, having spent quite a bit of time working on them for my
            final project. I was happy to have a week where everyone showed up, but I think the slack chat needs to be
            better as I fear we ought to be utilizing the group discussion options as we move into the business end of
            the semester. Ultimately, I am happy with how the week went and so can't really complain.</p>

        <div class="paragraph">
          <h2 id="week10">Week 10 : The Prodical Son Returns</h2>
          <p>Them came back! It was sudden and unexpected late on Wednesday after we attempted to meet together. I say
            attempted, really it was just Kimi and I that met initially, but as neither of us were the teacher we just
            discussed the final project and rescheduled for the next day. Later that evening, after we had attempted to
            meet, Them showed up expecting for the meeting to start. Seems he hadn't been aware of daylight savings and
            so was an hour late for our usual meeting time. </p>
          <p>When we were able to meet the next day he filled us in on
            his situation; seems his work schedule messed him up, which is understandable given the time difference and
            how early in the morning it always is for him to try to catch us at the right times. He taught this week's
            lessons and did a great job of that! The CSS Transitions, Tranforms, and Animations were his topics and he
            presented the material well and covered most of the topics. Kenny was present, but remained largely muted
            throughout, and Kimi wasn't able to make it on the rescheduled date.</p>
