          <h5>LOOPS, CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS, FUNCTIONS, VARIABLES, PARAMETERS, ARRAYS, ASSOCIATIVE ARRAYS</h5>
          <p>This lesson can be best understood by a few short scripts written for a few different outcomes. The first
            script is written to better look at all elements of the lesson except for Arrays and Associative Arrays,
            which
            we will cover hereafter. The script will ask the user to input two numbers, the first number will be raised
            to
            the power of the second and it will then display all iterations of that calculation until we reach the
            answer.
          </p>

          <p>The individual itterations will be shown so that the repetitions can be seen and understood as they happen
            rather than simply assuming they were or having to follow them in a script debugger. If you look at the
            JavaScript function calc(), you will notice the condition asking if the inputs (x and y) are greater than 0.
            If the statement is true, it will begin a while loop, (which could just as easily be substituted for a For
            loop) The loop uses a temporary variable of i to increment each time until it is the same as x and then it
            quits.</p>

          <p>To sum up, this first example includes a <b>loop</b>, <b>conditional statements</b>,
            <b>functions</b>, <b>variables</b> and <b>parameters</b>.
          </p>

            data-pen-title="qBEGKVB">

          </p>
          <script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
          <p>Alternatively, for our loop, we could have used:
            <pre class="codeBlock">
            for(var i=0,i <= y, i++){
              cal = Math.pow(x, i);
              output += x + " &lt;sup&gt;" + i + " &lt;/sup&gt; = " + addCommas(cal) + " &lt;br /&gt;";
            }</pre>

          </p>
          <p>NEXT let's look into <b>Arrays</b>! For this one, let's first create an array and then work
            with the values inside. We will also stringify the array so that we can visualize the array we have created.
          </p>

          <p class="codepen" data-height="400" data-theme-id="default" data-default-tab="js,result"
            data-user="costigan-stephen" data-slug-hash="OJPYovV"
            style="height: 400px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;"
            data-pen-title="OJPYovV">
            <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/costigan-stephen/pen/OJPYovV">
                OJPYovV</a> by Costigan-Stephen (<a href="https://codepen.io/costigan-stephen">@costigan-stephen</a>)
              on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
          </p>
          <script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

          <p>Lastly, <b>Associative Arrays</b>! In order to accomplish this one we will be separating the array
            attributes
            into separate inputs and then making an assessment based on mileage. I've added some sample data to make
            this
            easier, but the idea is that if the mileage is less than 100,000 you pass the assessment, otherwise, it will
            tell you that you should start saving up for a new car!</p>

          <p>We will stringify this array as well so that it will be easier to visualize. Notice the elements are
            separated with object names as well as values.</p>

          <p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-theme-id="default" data-default-tab="js,result"
            data-user="costigan-stephen" data-slug-hash="Jjoqame"
            style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;"

      <!--Lesson 2: Object Creation Functions, Inheritance, Properties, Methods, Instantiation. -->
      <section class="innerPadding fullwidth javascript whiteOverlay">
        <div class="paragraph">
          <h2 id="lesson2">LESSON 2</h2><br />
          <h5>OBJECT CREATION FUNCTIONS, INHERITANCE, PROPERTIES, METHODS, INSTANTIATION</h5>
          <p>After looking at the above lesson examples with associative arrays we might now understand better how we
            can create an object with pre-set values. For lack of a better example, we will use the car array above as
            our template object. We will be able to take this first object and make variations of it as we need to,
            which we will go into in a moment. For now, simply understand that the object we have made can be duplicated
            to make more.
            <pre class="codeBlock">
            var cars = {
              Make:"Ford",
              Model:"Falcon",
              Year:"2010",
              Mileage:"80000"
            };</pre>
          </p>
          <p>The above JavaScript initialized and created the object cars and gave it 4 properties of Make, Model, Year,
            and Mileage, which we can fill with input values or duplicate for use with other objects if we so chose. If
            we decide that we want to duplicate these properties into another object, there are a few different methods
            to do this.
          </p>
          <p>The SECOND method utilizes the Object.create method and looks like this:
            <pre class="codeBlock">
            var newCar = Object.create(cars);
                newCar.Make = "Toyota";
                newCar.Model = "Camry";
                newCar.Year = "2012";
                newCar.Mileage = "60000";</pre>
          </p>
          <p>You may notice that the new array "newCar" now has the same properties of Make, Model, Year, and Mileage as
            Cars did, but with entirely different values. This can be an effective method of creating a series of values
            based on the same properties. An example of where this might be useful is on occasions where you might want
            to
            compare two different cars online in a car buying scenario or otherwise. In these occasions there would
            likely
            be more properties to the vehicle such as asking price and condition.
          </p>
          <p>Next, the THIRD method utilizes functions to create objects:
            <pre class="codeBlock">
            function objCar(Make,Model,Year,Mileage) {
                this.Make = Make;
                this.Model = Model;
                this.Year = Year;
                this.Mileage = Mileage;
            }</pre>
          </p>
          <p>What just happened here is that the object objCar accepted 4 entries of Make, Model, Year, Mileage as
            property values for it's own fields. There are a number of reasons why you might want to copy existing
            values, but the main point is that these properties are either initialized or populated by the values
            entered into the function. Bottom line, objects are very useful! being able to associate a property with an
            object can be a lot better than trying to remember where we stored the value in an array.</p>

          <p>So, let's play with some code! Let's examine all three of the above in the example below:</p>
          <p class="codepen" data-height="400" data-theme-id="default" data-default-tab="js,result"
            data-user="costigan-stephen" data-slug-hash="wvavYLM"
            style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;"
            data-pen-title="Creating Objects">
