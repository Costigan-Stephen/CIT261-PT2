          <h5>LOOPS, CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS, FUNCTIONS, VARIABLES, PARAMETERS, ARRAYS, ASSOCIATIVE ARRAYS</h5>
          <p>This lesson can be best understood by a few short scripts written for a few different outcomes. The first
            script is written to better look at all elements of the lesson except for Arrays and Associative Arrays,
            which
            we will cover hereafter. The script will ask the user to input two numbers, the first number will be raised
            to
            the power of the second and it will then display all iterations of that calculation until we reach the
            answer.
          </p>

          <p>The individual itterations will be shown so that the repetitions can be seen and understood as they happen
            rather than simply assuming they were or having to follow them in a script debugger. If you look at the
            JavaScript function calc(), you will notice the condition asking if the inputs (x and y) are greater than 0.
            If the statement is true, it will begin a while loop, (which could just as easily be substituted for a For
            loop) The loop uses a temporary variable of i to increment each time until it is the same as x and then it
            quits.</p>

          <p>To sum up, this first example includes a <b>loop</b>, <b>conditional statements</b>,
            <b>functions</b>, <b>variables</b> and <b>parameters</b>.
          </p>

            data-pen-title="qBEGKVB">

          </p>
          <script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
          <p>Alternatively, for our loop, we could have used:</p>
          <pre class="codeBlock">
for(var i=0;i <= y; i++){
  cal = Math.pow(x, i);
  output += x + " &lt;sup&gt;" + i + " &lt;/sup&gt; = " + addCommas(cal) + " &lt;br /&gt;";
}</pre>

          <p>NEXT let's look into <b>Arrays</b>! For this one, let's first create an array and then work
            with the values inside. We will also stringify the array so that we can visualize the array we have created.
          </p>

          <p class="codepen" data-height="450" data-theme-id="default" data-default-tab="js,result"
            data-user="costigan-stephen" data-slug-hash="OJPYovV"
            style="height: 400px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;"
            data-pen-title="OJPYovV">
            <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/costigan-stephen/pen/OJPYovV">
                OJPYovV</a> by Costigan-Stephen (<a href="https://codepen.io/costigan-stephen">@costigan-stephen</a>)

          </p>
          <script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

          <p>Lastly, <b>Associative Arrays</b>! In order to accomplish this one we will be separating the array
            attributes
            into separate inputs and then making an assessment based on mileage. I've added some sample data to make
            this
            easier, but the idea is that if the mileage is less than 100,000 you pass the assessment, otherwise, it will
            tell you that you should start saving up for a new car!</p>

          <p>We will stringify this array as well so that it will be easier to visualize. Notice the elements are
            separated with object names as well as values.</p>

          <p class="codepen" data-height="400" data-theme-id="default" data-default-tab="js,result"

      <!--Lesson 2: Object Creation Functions, Inheritance, Properties, Methods, Instantiation. -->
      <section class="innerPadding fullwidth javascript whiteOverlay">
        <div class="paragraph">
          <h2 id="lesson2">LESSON 2</h2><br />
          <h5>OBJECT CREATION FUNCTIONS, INHERITANCE, PROPERTIES, METHODS, INSTANTIATION</h5>
          <p>After looking at the above lesson examples with associative arrays we might now understand better how we
            can create an object with pre-set values. For lack of a better example, we will use the car array above as
            our template object. We will be able to take this first object and make variations of it as we need to,
            which we will go into in a moment. For now, simply understand that the object we have made can be duplicated
            to make more.
            <pre class="codeBlock">
var cars = {
  Make:"Ford",
  Model:"Falcon",
  Year:"2010",
  Mileage:"80000"
};</pre>
          </p>
          <p>The above JavaScript initialized and created the object cars and gave it 4 properties of Make, Model, Year,
            and Mileage, which we can fill with input values or duplicate for use with other objects if we so chose. If
            we decide that we want to duplicate these properties into another object, there are a few different methods
            to do this.
          </p>
          <p>The SECOND method utilizes the Object.create method and looks like this:
            <pre class="codeBlock">
var newCar = Object.create(cars);
  newCar.Make = "Toyota";
  newCar.Model = "Camry";
  newCar.Year = "2012";
  newCar.Mileage = "60000";</pre>
          </p>
          <p>You may notice that the new array "newCar" now has the same properties of Make, Model, Year, and Mileage as
            Cars did, but with entirely different values. This can be an effective method of creating a series of values
            based on the same properties. An example of where this might be useful is on occasions where you might want
            to
            compare two different cars online in a car buying scenario or otherwise. In these occasions there would
            likely
            be more properties to the vehicle such as asking price and condition.
          </p>
          <p>Next, the THIRD method utilizes functions to create objects:
            <pre class="codeBlock">
function objCar(Make,Model,Year,Mileage) {
  this.Make = Make;
  this.Model = Model;
  this.Year = Year;
  this.Mileage = Mileage;
}</pre>
          </p>
          <p>What just happened here is that the object objCar accepted 4 entries of Make, Model, Year, Mileage as
            property values for it's own fields. There are a number of reasons why you might want to copy existing
            values, but the main point is that these properties are either initialized or populated by the values
            entered into the function. Bottom line, objects are very useful! being able to associate a property with an
            object can be a lot better than trying to remember where we stored the value in an array.</p>

          <p>So, let's play with some code! Let's examine all three of the above in the example below:</p>
          <p class="codepen" data-height="400" data-theme-id="default" data-default-tab="js,result"
            data-user="costigan-stephen" data-slug-hash="wvavYLM"
            style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;"

          <h5>STANDARD JAVASCRIPT EVENTS INCLUDING THOSE FOR MOBILE DEVICES AND ANIMATION AND TRANSITION EVENTS</h5>
          <p>There are a lot of events we can look at, but in this section we will be focusing a lot JavaScript events
            that work on Mobile devices. Mozilla Developer tells us that "Touch events consist of three interfaces
            (<b>Touch</b>, <b>TouchEvent</b> and <b>TouchList</b>)" -<a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events/Using_Touch_Events">Source</a>. To
            start, let's look at all the possible event types that are
            built for touch devices only.</p>

          <pre class="codeBlock">
touchstart <span class="comment">   //fired when a touch point is placed on the touch surface.</span>
touchmove <span class="comment">    //fired when a touch point is moved along the touch surface.</span>
touchend <span class="comment">     //fired when a touch point is removed from the touch surface.</span>
touchcancel <span class="comment">  //fired when a touch point has been disrupted in an implementation-specific manner 
                                      (for example, too many touch points are created).</span></pre>
          <p>Mozilla developer goes a little further than that to explain the touchEvents that are available to a touch
            device. They are as follows:</p>
          <pre class="codeBlock">
touches <span class="comment">        //a list of all of the touch points currently on the screen.</span>
targetTouches <span class="comment">  //a list of the touch points on the target DOM element.</span>
changedTouches <span class="comment"> //a list of the touch points whose items depends on the associated event type:</span>
    >> <b>touchstart</b>  - A list of the touch points that became active with the current event.
    >> <b>touchmove</b>   - A list of the touch points that have changed since the last event.
    >> <b>touchend</b>    - A list of the touch points that have been removed from the surface 
                      (the set of touch points corresponding to fingers no longer touching the surface).</pre>
          <p>Based on these events a programmer is able to utilize touch gestures to allow a user to interact with a
            layout and make things happen. For our purposes, we will first look into some basic examples that can be
            utilized on a mobile device.</p>
          <p>So, how does that help us? Well, we can attach things called <b>Listeners</b> to elements so that they can
            be interacted with by the user. These <b>Listeners</b> are useful for recording the events listed above and
            must be used in this format:</p>
          <pre class="codeBlock">
element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture)</pre>
          <p>Where <b>Event</b> can be one of those listed above if using a touch device, or can involve the Mouse or
            Keyboard if using a computer. <b>Function</b> refers to when the <b>Event</b> happens and can include such
            cases as a drag function or a finger tap etc. Or even, for arguments sake, a finger release. The last
            parameter, <b>useCapture</b>, is optional and appears as a boolean true or false value, which relates to
            when the action occurs. Whether the action occurs in what is known as the 'capture phase' or the 'bubbling
            phase'. But what is a bubbling phase?</p>

          <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2003/NOTE-DOM-Level-3-Events-20031107/events.html#Events-phases">W3 Schools
              has a great guide</a> to this as it relates to the DOM in which they
            state:</p>
          <p class=highlight>The DOM event flow is the process through which the event originates from the DOM Events
            implementation and is dispatched into a tree. Each event has an event target, a targeted node in the case
            of the DOM Event flow, toward which the event is dispatched by the DOM Events implementation.</p>
          <p>A good way to imagine this is using the following image:</p>
          <img class="center" src="images/eventflow.png" alt="event Flow" style="width:100%;">
          <p>As this image, <a
              href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2003/NOTE-DOM-Level-3-Events-20031107/events.html#Events-phases">courtesy of
              W3 Schools</a>, shows us, the actions are broken down in 3 phases. Namely:<br />
            <div class="highlight">
              <b>1. The capture phase:</b> the event is dispatched to the target's ancestors from the root of the
              tree to
              the direct parent of the target node.<br />
              <b>2. The target phase:</b> the event is dispatched to the target node.<br />
              <b>3. The bubbling phase:</b> the event is dispatched to the target's ancestors from the direct parent
              of
              the target node to the root of the tree.<br /></div>
          </p>

          <p>So lets get into some coding! What if we had some text that changed color when the mouse went over it?
            Hover effects are pretty fun to do.</p>
          <p class="codepen" data-height="305" data-theme-id="default" data-default-tab="js,result"
            data-user="costigan-stephen" data-slug-hash="eYNvXjK"
            style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;"
            data-pen-title="eYNvXjK">
            <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/costigan-stephen/pen/eYNvXjK">
                eYNvXjK</a> by Costigan-Stephen (<a href="https://codepen.io/costigan-stephen">@costigan-stephen</a>)

          </p>
          <script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
          <p>
            Did you guess right? The random color made that harder to get right, but it also made for a cool effect.
            Overall, the whole thing is pretty neat huh? The commands used here, as you can see from the example code,
            utilize the onmouseover and onmouseout to determine when the mouse is and isn't on the text. This can also
            be done with objects and CSS. And that's it!
