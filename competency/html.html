          <h5>LOCAL STORAGE API, STORING AND RETRIEVING SIMPLE DATA, ARRAYS, ASSOCIATIVE ARRAYS, AND OBJECTS</h5>
          <p>
            So there's some good fun to be had with Local Storage API's, but first we need to understand what they are.
            There are primarily 2 variations of that storage. First, Local Storage (obviously), secondly Session
            Storage.
            Both Local Storage and Session Storage serve different purposes and can store up to 5 MB of text. That may
            not
            seem like much, but when you consider that 1 character is equal to 1 byte, you realize that 5MB is about 5
            Million characters. When you consider that the average book has about 350 words a page (1500 to 1800
            characters per page), that's only about 400,000 - 500,000 characters (bytes), on average, which is about a
            tenth of the storage that either Local or Session storage provide.</p>

          <p>So, what is Session Storage, and how does it differ from Local Storage? Simply put, Session storage is
            information that is stored only during your current session of browsing. This could be something like your
            shopping cart on a website or field entries when registering for something. Local storage, on the other
            hand,
            is information that exists beyond your current session. This can be just about anything, but a good example
            might be the chrome function that auto fills your information or remembers your passwords when you allow it
            to.</p>

          <p>It's important to know that the commands for Local Storage and Session Storage are completely
            interchangeable, which is nice, so as we go through I will introduce both of them, but focus entirely on
            only
            one of them for the sake of simplicity. It's also worth noting that this will tie in to some more JSON, so
            make sure you check that out first! So what are the commands? Let's have a look!
            <pre class="codeBlock">
(replace Local for Session if you need Session Storage)

<div class="comment">//Storing Data methods</div>
1. localStorage.setItem("key", "value");
2. localStorage["key"] = value;

<div class="comment">//Example:</div>
1. localStorage.setItem("Make", "Nissan");
2. localStorage["Make"] = "Nissan";

<div class="comment">//Retrieving Stored Data</div>
var myData = localStorage["key"];

<div class="comment">//Example</div>
var Make = localStorage["Make"]; <div class="comment">//Not Nissan, notice the difference</div>

<div class="comment">//Removing Stored Data</div>
localStorage.clear(); <div class="comment">//Removes EVERYTHING! Not advisable</div>
localStorage.removeItem("key");

You can also store strings using JSON Stringify as an alternative.</pre>
            <br />

          </p>
          <p>I know I said it in there, but I need to reiterate that localStorage.clear is NOT recommended. It's known
            as
            a scorched earth approach for a reason because it removes all stored local files, even ones you may not have
            wanted to remove. Also worth noting, you can store a string of variables using JSON Stringify, or you can
            store just one value, whatever you desire. For the purposes of our examples here we will only be storing
            individual values.</p>

          <p>Now that we know the commands, let's mess with it a little bit. First, let's focus primarily on storing
            data.
            After that we'll look at setting specific keys to retrieve and manipulate data. In this first example, we
            will
            be focussed entirely on the similarities between local and session storage.</p>

          <script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
          <p>Next, let's look at how to store and retrieve data using something called a <i>'key'</i>. You probably
            noticed that in the previous example we simply used the word <b>key</b> as our <i>key</i>, now we will set a
            custom <i>key</i> and retrieve information from it or show all stored information using JSON stringify.
            To make things simple, since the syntax is the same, we'll only work with Local Storage. Without further
            ado,
            Let's get into it!</p>

      <!--Lesson 6: DOM Manipulation Using createElement, appendChild, insertBefore, removeChild, etc. -->
      <section class="innerPadding fullwidth html whiteOverlay">
        <div class="paragraph">
          <h2 id="lesson6">LESSON 6</h2><br />
          <h5>DOM MANIPULATION USING CREATEELEMENT, APPENDCHILD, INSERTBEFORE, REMOVECHILD, ETC</h5>
          <p>Do you know what you are looking at right now? A DOM. The DOM of this page is pretty great right? objects
            that make up my layout are part of a structure, a Document Object Model. What you might not know though is
            that the DOM
            can be CHANGED!
            <u>But what exactly does it mean?</u></p>
          <p>It means that we can reorganize the objects on the layout! Or more than that, make new ones or remove
            them entirely!</p>
          <h3>Creating Elements</h1>
            <p>So let's start with Creating new Elements! It’s easy to create elements, all you need to do is something
              like this in JavaScript:</p>

            <pre class="codeBlock">
document.createElement("elementName");
<div class="comment">//Example</div>
document.createElement(“theFifth”);	</pre>

            <p>So we create an element called "The Fifth", pun intended, but what now? “theFifth” element does not exist
              on our layout, we need to
              go ahead and add it somewhere</p>

            <p>To do that, we need to do something like this</p>

            <pre class="codeBlock">
&ltscript&gt
	var newElement = document.createElement(“theFifth”);
	newElement.textContent = “My name is a pun”;
	document.body.appendChild(newElement);
&lt/script&gt	</pre>

            <p>So, in case you didn't pick up on what just happened, this places our new element at the bottom of the
              Body element. The Fifth Element now exists as an element of our DOM. This image is <a
                href="https://www.kirupa.com/html5/creating_dom_elements_and_other_stuff.htm#jsBookContent">based on a
                Kirupa tutorial</a>, but has been changed slightly from theirs.</p>

            <div class="center"><img src="images/DOM.png" style="max-width: 80%;"></div>
            <br />
            <h3>Removing Elements</h3>
            <p>Just as it is easy to add elements, it’s just as easy to remove them. To remove “theFifth” we simply need
              to do the following</p>
            <pre class="codeBlock">document.body.removeChild(newElement);</pre>

            <p>You may notice that we used the variable name from our create element script rather than the element
              name, this is something worth remembering. Again, you can use this to remove objects that are native to
              the layout such as h1 etc. Removing an object, it also removes all of it’s children.</p>
            <br />
            <h3>Cloning Elements</h3>
            <p>What if we wanted to clone an element? This is a bit more complicated, but not by much. It requires a
              little extra explanation. Let’s start
              by looking at this code: </p>

            <pre class="codeBlock">
&ltdiv id="footer"&gt
        &ltdiv class="share"&gt
            &ltp&gtSomething&lt/p&gt
            &ltimg alt="#" src="blah.png"/&gt
        &lt/div&gt
&lt/div&gt
 					
&ltscript&gt
        var share = document.querySelector(".share");
        var shareClone = share.cloneNode(true); <div class="comment">// False means only clone the div and not what is in it</div>
 
        document.querySelector("#footer").appendChild(shareClone);
&lt/script&gt </pre>

            <p>It should look something like this if done correctly. Note, these changes don’t modify the original
              code.
            </p>
            <pre class="codeBlock">
&ltdiv id="footer"&gt
        &ltdiv class="share"&gt
            &ltp&gtSomething&lt/p&gt
            &ltimg alt="#" src="blah.png"/&gt
        &lt/div&gt
        &ltdiv class="shareClone"&gt
            &ltp&gtSomething&lt/p&gt
            &ltimg alt="#" src="blah.png"/&gt
        &lt/div&gt
&lt/div&gt </pre>

            <p>Looking at this code again, we notice that the cloned element was added, or appended, to the footer
              using <b>appendChild</b>. Its uses are not limited to cloning, but otherwise is pretty self explanatory.
            </p>
            <pre class="codeBlock">
&ltdiv id="footer"&gt
        &ltdiv class="share"&gt
            &ltp&gtSomething&lt/p&gt
            &ltimg alt="#" src="blah.png"/&gt
        &lt/div&gt
&lt/div&gt
&ltscript&gt
        var share = document.querySelector(".share");
        var shareClone = share.cloneNode(true); <div class="comment">// False means only clone the div and not what is in it</div>
 
        document.querySelector("#footer").appendChild(shareClone);
&lt/script&gt	</pre>

            <p>The native function of <b>insertBefore</b> will allow you to move an element to anywhere you think
              might look best within
              the same parent. For example, if I wanted “theFifth” element to be placed before the heading, I would
              use the following code:</p>
            <pre class="codeBlock">
var newElement = document.createElement(“theFifth”);
newElement.textContent = “My name is a pun”;
 
var h1Element = document.querySelector(“h1”);
document.body.insertBefore(newElement, h1Element);</pre>
            <br />
            <h3>Putting it all together</h3>
            <p>So let's play around with creating and removing elements! For this one I decided to go with the topics
              of this assignment, namely: CSS, JAVASCRIPT, JSON, and HTML.
              I went a little overboard with this as I wanted the values to rotate between them and utilized session
              storage for added fun.</p>

            <p>Shall we give it a try? Be my guest! there are 3 buttons to play with an no limits. Go nuts!</p>

          <h5>HTML5 TAGS - VIDEO, AUDIO, AND CANVAS</h5>
          <p>So we're left with some of the easier parts of HTML at the tail end of the semester. We'll start by talking
            about <b>Video</b> elements, which are perhaps the most common. Fortunately, Most websites that make videos
            these days will give you an embed code, making them relatively easy to share and post. So let's look at some
            code!
          </p>
          <pre class="codeBlock">
&ltvideo width="320" height="240" controls&gt
    &ltsource src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt
    &ltsource src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg"&gt
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt/video&gt </pre>
          <p>The example above is courtesy of <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_video.asp">W3 Schools</a>.
            You may notice in the example that there is a <i>controls</i> attribute. This is optional, but it can also
            be accompanied by other attributes such as:</p>
          <pre class="codeBlock"><strong class="comment">Attribute   Value     Description</strong>
autoplay    autoplay  Specifies that the video will start playing as soon as it is ready
controls    controls  Specifies that video controls should be displayed (such as a play/pause button etc).
height      pixels    Sets the height of the video player
loop        loop      Specifies that the video will start over again, every time it is finished
muted       muted     Specifies that the audio output of the video should be muted poster URL Specifies an image to be shown 
                      while the video is downloading, or until the user hits the play button
preload     auto      Specifies if and how the author thinks the video should be loaded when the page loads
            metadata
            none
src         URL       Specifies the URL of the video file
width       pixels    Sets the width of the video player </pre>

          <p>So let's post a video example of this. The following video comes courtesy of YouTube, which has its own
            embedding tools, and really serves no purpose other than entertainment.</p>
          <iframe class="center video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4UDnTJcjPhY" frameborder="0"
            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          <p>Next, let's look at <b>Audio</b>! Fortunately, audio holds many of the same controls as video, which we
            will examine below. Consider the following audio segment:</p>
          <pre class="codeBlock">
&ltaudio controls&gt
    &ltsource src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mp3"&gt
    &ltsource src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg"&gt
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
&lt/audio&gt </pre>
          <p>Worth noticing, there are three audio types that are supported by this element, they are:</p>
          <pre class="codeBlock"><strong class="comment">File Format     Media Type</strong>
MP3             audio/mpeg
OGG             audio/ogg
WAV             audio/wav</pre>
          <p>You'll also notice from the above code that the audio, like the video, also has the controls property,
            which is not included by default with an audio tag. If we were to add the audio without controls it would
            mean the viewer would not have the ability to control it. This might be useful if we are adding sound
            effects or ambiance to an element. Removing controls hides the element from the DOM.</p>
          <p>Alternatively, it is highly possible to create an annoying and repetative sound on repeat and autoplay that
            has no controls to be stopped. I do not advise this method, but it is available to you if that is your
            desire and you are one of those people who delights in the misery of others. For my example, I decided not
            to do that and have acquired a nice seagull sound instead, having grown up around the ocean.</p>
          <audio controls class="center">
            <source src="assets/seagulls.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
            Your browser does not support audio of seagulls.
          </audio>
          <p>It's also worth mentioning that the &ltsource&gt tag can define multiple media elements of &ltaudio&gt and
            &ltvideo&gt.</p>
          <p>Lastly, the <b>Canvas</b> tag, which is perhaps the most complicated and could realistically have its own
            lesson devoted to it. It's an extremely elaborate element that can be used to create images, present images,
            create animated objects, and a number of awesome things. There are a number of properties and methods that
            we can modify within a canvas. Here are the main properties and methods that can be modified and if you
            desire to dig deeper feel free to check out <a

<span class="comment">Paths:</span> - Similar to lines, but with this you have the option of filling an area you have drawn over. Also, manipulation of points can change a shape. Also, you can create arcs, which is pretty cool really. We will play with this one later as it is a lot of fun!
<span class="comment">Transformations:</span> - Your basic rotation, scale, and manipulations of an existing shape.
<span class="comment">Text:</span> - Self explanatory, you can change the font and style of the text as well.
<span class="comment">Image Drawing:</span> - Originally thought this would be a canvas for accepting mouse drawings, but turns out it's a place you can put in an image (i.e a painting).
<span class="comment">Pixel Manipulation:</span> - Similar to rectangles, essentially you are building a shape, but it is entirely a pixel drawing and not a series of defined lines that happen to be filled.
<span class="comment">Compositing:</span> - Change the transparency or overlap and manipulation of existing images
<span class="comment">Other:</span> - Some miscellaneous commands such as saving the state and restoring previous save.</pre>
          <p>It's important to note that each of these headers has a lot of properties or methods to them. The reference
            link above gives an exhaustive tutorial on each of them. Something interesting with canvas images, which I
            will be using for the example for this section, is that they can be layered. The example below consists of a
            number of layered paths with fills and or strokes that creates an image. It's a great explanation of how a
            canvas can be used to create interesting and intricate designs using simple line manipulation.</p>

          <p>The canvas example above could have been made using a single variable, but it has been done so that the
            different components of the face can be easier to follow in the code. The elements overlap based on when
            they are created, the earlier created elements are at the back and the latter are in front. This heirachy
            allows a more complicated image to be created.</p>
          <p>This next example utilizes a tutorial from W3 Schools that helps the user create a working clock using
            canvas. Unlike the previous example, I did not create this on my own, but followed <a
              href="https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_clock.asp">this tutorial</a> in order to
            create the clock.</p>

          <p>There are so many cool things you can do with canvas and I fear I've only scratched the surface for myself.
            W3 Schools also offers a tutorial to create a canvas game, demonstrating the dynamic usage of
            it as an element. I'm not going to include it here, but I'll share a <a
              href="https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/game_intro.asp">link</a> to it in case there is any
            interest. And that's it!</p>
