          <h5>MANIPULATING CSS CLASS PROPERTIES USING JAVASCRIPT</h5>
          <p>I've always loved CSS! This section represents not only
            some cool CSS, but experimenting with cool ways to modify properties of DOM objects with CSS using
            JavaScript. So strap yourself in, we're in for a wild ride.</p>

          <p>First, let's look at some simple text manipulation. Let's have some fun with it.</p>
          <p class="codepen" data-height="350" data-theme-id="default" data-default-tab="css,result"
            data-user="costigan-stephen" data-slug-hash="rNVeYKM"
            style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;"
            data-pen-title="CSS Modify">
            <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/costigan-stephen/pen/rNVeYKM">
                CSS Modify</a> by Costigan-Stephen (<a href="https://codepen.io/costigan-stephen">@costigan-stephen</a>)
              on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
          </p>
          <script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
          <p>We can change any aspect of an object's class using JavaScript using the following syntax:</p>
          <pre class="codeBlock">
document.getElementById(<span class="comment">[elementId]</span>).style.<span class="comment">[cssProperty]</span> = <span class="comment">[newValue]</span>;</pre>
          <br />
          <p>In the example above, we manipulated the text using the <b><span class="comment">style.color</span></b>
            attribute and the visibility of the text using <b><span class="comment">style.visibility</span></b>, which
            allowed us to show or hide elements as need be. For a full list of available styles that can be changed and
            how they can be changed, check <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_style.asp">this link</a></p>
          </p>
          <p>Next, let's change the class of an object with javaScript. This next example will turn an object from a box
            into a circle. It will do this by changing the CSS class of the object. and trigger an animation in the
            process. The basic concept here is that utilizing the power of JavaScript, we can do almost anything we want
            within reason.</p>

          <h5>CREATING CSS3 TRANSITIONS AND ANIMATIONS IN CSS AND TRIGGERING THEM WITH JAVASCRIPT</h5>
          <p>We did a little bit of this toward the end of Lesson 7 with the shape changing, but we'll cover it in more
            detail here. The important thing to notice is that in the above example, the shape transitioned gradually
            into another shape, it didn't suddenly become a square or a circle. That process was an animation. Our
            example above only had 2 key frames, but we can add more transition points to reach our desired effect.</p>
          <p>in the next example, we will get a little bit fancy with transitions and animations triggered by
            javascript. The JavaScript adds the class 'active' to the outlying div and therefore creates a two-state
            animation that can include even more states given the right circumstances. The example I created below
            utilizes some fun animations to make a pulsing yellow orb fall behind and above a background shape. The
            effect it creates is a sunset, which is prompted by the users click. Click on the sun to see all of
            this in action!</p>
          <p class="codepen" data-height="335" data-theme-id="default" data-default-tab="css,result"
            data-user="costigan-stephen" data-slug-hash="RwPaxON"
            style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;"
            data-pen-title="Sunset">

          </p>
          <script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
          <p>Animations can also be triggered when the user hovers over the object. A prime example of this can be found
            with this example, where the object constantly changes direction when the user hovers the mouse over the
            object.</p>

          <h5>DESIGNING, DEFINING, AND TRIGGERING CSS3 TRANSITIONS, TRANSFORMS, AND ANIMATIONS WITHOUT CUSTOM LIBRARIES
          </h5>
          <p>This is the section that I've most looked forward to as CSS is one of my favorite programming languages. I
            love programming, but at my core I'm really a designer, so CSS is the one programming language where I get
            to really express myself artistically. Unlike previous sections, I've decided to group the three of these
            components under one banner, but have separated them into smaller parts as they share many similar elements
            that can be referenced between them.</p>

          <!--CSS Transitions
          //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
          <section class="innerPadding sectionarea">

            <h3>CSS Transitions</h3>
            <p>First, let's look at <b>CSS Transitions</b>. These are a lot of fun and can really make for some cool
              effects like the example above where the sphere transitions from green to blue in 1 second. Here, we will
              use some similar animations and go over some of the properties that are related to transitions in CSS. The
              main properties that are modified in a CSS Transition are as follows:</p>

            <pre class="codeBlock">
transition
transition-delay
transition-duration
transition-property
transition-timing-function</pre>

            <p>These can all be expressed within a simple transform statement, or can be outlined in separate lines as
              shown above. If we were to compare the two, it might look like the following example:</p>

            <pre class="codeBlock">
div {
  transition-property: height;
  transition-duration: 5s;
  transition-timing-function: ease;
  transition-delay: 2s;
}
<div class="comment">// is equivalent to:</div>
div {
  transition: height 5s ease 2s;
}</pre>

            <p id="timing-functions">Among these effects, the transitions can be customized further to create some truly
              awesome effects. The
              <code>transition-timing-function</code>, for example, comes with added customizations that allow the user
              to
              specify the speed curve of the transition effect. We will demonstrate some examples of some of these
              comparatively, but first, the values are as follows:</p>
            <pre class="codeBlock">
ease <div class="comment">- specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)</div>
linear <div class="comment">- specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end</div>
ease-in <div class="comment">- specifies a transition effect with a slow start</div>
ease-out <div class="comment">- specifies a transition effect with a slow end</div>
ease-in-out <div class="comment">- specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end</div>
cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) <div class="comment">- lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function</div></pre>

            <p>So, let's see some of these in action! The code below is based loosely on a <a
                href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp">W3 Schools demonstration</a> of transition
              timing functions. Notice when the transitioning objects slow down or speed up is different in each
              instance.
            </p>

            <p class="codepen" data-height="375" data-theme-id="default" data-default-tab="css,result"
              data-user="costigan-stephen" data-slug-hash="ZEGoVpw"
              style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;"
              data-pen-title="ZEGoVpw">
              <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/costigan-stephen/pen/ZEGoVpw">
                  ZEGoVpw</a> by Costigan-Stephen (<a href="https://codepen.io/costigan-stephen">@costigan-stephen</a>)
                on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
            </p>
            <script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

            <p>
              The transitions demonstrated above are the width and background color, which are both transitioned
              using the <code>transition-property</code> of <code>all</code> rather than specifying them individually
              for
              the duration specified for the animation. The syntax of that property can be any of the following:</p>

            <pre class="codeBlock">transition-property: none|all|property|initial|inherit;</pre>

            <p>Also, notably, the <code>transition-timing-function</code> was applied outside of the transition
              statement
              and within the individual objects, further showing the versatility that these commands can have. </p>
          </section>

          <!--CSS Transforms
          //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
          <section class="innerPadding sectionarea">
            <h3>CSS Transforms</h3>
            <p>For ease of delivery, this section will be split into two parts, namely: 2D Transforms, and 3D
              Transforms.
              First, let's look into the different transform properties:</p>
            <pre class="codeBlock">
translate()
rotate()
scaleX()
scaleY()
scale()
skewX()
skewY()
skew()
matrix()</pre>

            <p>In order to best demonstrate this, we thought it would be good to look into some examples of each of
              these
              in action! There's some good fun that we can have, for example:</p>
            <p class="codepen" data-height="355" data-theme-id="default" data-default-tab="js,result"
              data-user="costigan-stephen" data-slug-hash="rNVvbBo"
              style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;"
              data-pen-title="rNVvbBo">
              <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/costigan-stephen/pen/rNVvbBo">
                  rNVvbBo</a> by Costigan-Stephen (<a href="https://codepen.io/costigan-stephen">@costigan-stephen</a>)
                on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
            </p>
            <script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

            <p>You may have noticed that in most of the scenarios above, I used Translate in conjunction with the
              advertised command. This was purely for aesthetics, but demonstrates the ability to combine multiple
              transform effects. Now, let's take a look at 3D Transforms, this is where this really gets interesting!
              The
              following list presents available Transform Properties.</p>
            <pre
              class="codeBlock"><b><u>Property</u>                <u>Description</u></b>
transform               <div class="comment">Applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element</div>
transform-origin        <div class="comment">Allows you to change the position on transformed elements</div>
transform-style         <div class="comment">Specifies how nested elements are rendered in 3D space</div>
perspective             <div class="comment">Specifies the perspective on how 3D elements are viewed</div>
perspective-origin      <div class="comment">Specifies the bottom position of 3D elements</div>
backface-visibility     <div class="comment">Defines whether or not an element should be visible when not facing the screen</div></pre>

            <p>Also, of some further interest, is the following Transform Methods that can be used. As there is a lot of
              potential with this, we will largely be covering these with one functional example, like we did for the 2D
              Transformations.</p>

            <pre class="codeBlock"><b><u>Function</u>                <u>Description</u></b>
matrix3d                <div class="comment">(n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n) Defines a 3D transformation, using a 4x4 matrix of 16 values</div>
translate3d(x,y,z)      <div class="comment">Defines a 3D translation</div>
translateX(x)           <div class="comment">Defines a 3D translation, using only the value for the X-axis</div>
translateY(y)           <div class="comment">Defines a 3D translation, using only the value for the Y-axis</div>
translateZ(z)           <div class="comment">Defines a 3D translation, using only the value for the Z-axis</div>
scale3d(x,y,z)          <div class="comment">Defines a 3D scale transformation</div>
scaleX(x)               <div class="comment">Defines a 3D scale transformation by giving a value for the X-axis</div>
scaleY(y)               <div class="comment">Defines a 3D scale transformation by giving a value for the Y-axis</div>
scaleZ(z)               <div class="comment">Defines a 3D scale transformation by giving a value for the Z-axis</div>
rotate3d(x,y,z,angle)   <div class="comment">Defines a 3D rotation</div>
rotateX(angle)          <div class="comment">Defines a 3D rotation along the X-axis</div>
rotateY(angle)          <div class="comment">Defines a 3D rotation along the Y-axis</div>
rotateZ(angle)          <div class="comment">Defines a 3D rotation along the Z-axis</div>
perspective(n)          <div class="comment">Defines a perspective view for a 3D transformed element</div></pre>

            <p>Similar to how we demonstrated above, let's take a look at each of the different transform properties
              when applied to an object such as the one below. For this, a button will be provided to cycle through each
              one and define what is happening for each. All Z-Related commands have had rotation added to them for ease
              of demonstration as they are not able to be visualized on a 2D plane. They operate best when the object is
              not facing directly at the screen and so the rotation allows for that to be easier to visualize.</p>

            <p>And that should be good as far as basic 3D Transformations are concerned. Clearly each of these
              demonstrated uses are not a comprehensive list, but demonstrate some cool uses for these commands!</p>

            <p>The below demonstration of these methods in action has been modified from the original version found in
              David DeSandro's <a href="https://3dtransforms.desandro.com/perspective">Intro to CSS 3D Transforms</a>.
              It gives a nice idea of how much potential one can find using these methods and what might truly be
              possible with enough time and energy. Pay particular note as you mess with it how the modifications to the
              perspective impact the rotating cube.</p>

            <p>That about covers it, there's a lot of potential here and it's difficult to demonstrate every capability
              that these commands have, given the possibilites are almost endless. For now, let's leave it at that.</p>

          <!--CSS Animations
          //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// -->
          <section class="innerPadding sectionarea">
            <h3>CSS Animations</h3>
            <p>The Last section we will discuss here will be about <b>CSS Animations</b>. Animations are a lot of fun
              and
              can be triggered in a number of different ways, from hover effects, to class changes, to onclick events.
              There are numerous ways to trigger and create them, which makes them extremely versatile and easy to work
              with. Animations can be defined with the following properties: </p>

            <pre class="codeBlock">
@keyframes
animation-name
animation-duration
animation-delay
animation-iteration-count
animation-direction
animation-timing-function
animation-fill-mode
animation</pre>
            <p>Something that needs further clarification from the above list is the <code>animation-fill-mode</code>,
              which specifies a default value that an object can have while an animation is not running. This can be
              defined with the following values:</p>
            <pre class="codeBlock">
none <div class="comment">- Default value. Animation will not apply any styles to the element before or after it is executing</div>
forwards <div class="comment">- The element will retain the style values that is set by the last keyframe (depends on animation-direction and animation-iteration-count)</div>
backwards <div class="comment">- The element will get the style values that is set by the first keyframe (depends on animation-direction), and retain this during the animation-delay period</div>
both <div class="comment">- The animation will follow the rules for both forwards and backwards, extending the animation properties in both directions</div></pre>

            <p>Also of note, these animations can also utilize the same <code>timing-functions</code> as <a
                href="#timing-functions">above</a>. This allows for animations to be defined with keyframes, but also
              allows for animation related timing to be defined. Rather than get into that, as I feel this is well
              represented above, let's get into a demonstration. You may have noticed that similar to transitions, the
              animation can be defined with one line or by specifying the properties on separate lines. For example:</p>
            <pre class="codeBlock">
div {
  animation-name: moveblock;
  animation-duration: 3s;
  animation-iteration-infinite: 2;
}
<div class="comment">// is equivalent to:</div>
div {
  animation: moveblock 3s infinite;
}</pre>
            <p>By way of demonstration, I've decided to use an animation that I created for my final project, but this
              time it will be triggered from hovering over text rather than as background content. This example uses
              content from another lesson in that there are animations triggered on and off of hover. This afore
              mentioned
              hover effect triggers a JavaScript class change, but the same could be done with CSS hover effects. You
              will
              find that as you place your mouse over the central text box, the animation shows the background getting
              flooded, whereas removing your mouse from the text area drains the water from the image. Feel free to mess
              with it, I know I've certainly done plenty of that.

            <p>So, that's about it, I think we've covered the essentials to making a good CSS Animation, but like with
              the other elements there is still far more than can be covered in a quick competency writeup.</p>
