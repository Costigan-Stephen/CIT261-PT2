<p>The objects here are intended to display competency in a series of subjects ranging from HTML to JavaScript to JSON
    and CSS. It must be first acknowledged that the theme used in this project was created from an existing template and
    modified to suit the purposes of this assignment.</p>
<br>
<p>That said, all other HTML and CSS were created in accordance to the requirements of the lessons so as to present a
    level of competency required by this course. Any similarities in the latter code with existing code is purely
    coincidental and the result of serendipity.</p>
